        Most issues regarding Ulauncher extensions are caused by missing Python dependencies that are required for the extension to work.

        If you get a `Type: KeyError` error when saving the extension preferences for example, a missing dependency is mostly the cause.

        Please make sure to check the project README for a list of Python extensions to install.

        Also Check [this](https://ulauncher-extension-doesnt-install-and-now.netlify.app/) website for more details.

        Please copy and paste the extension logs. The best way to get them:
        - Close any Ulauncher instance that you have running (full close, not minimize)
        - From the command line run: `ulauncher -v --dev |& grep "<extension-name>"`, replacing <extension_name> with the name of the extension. (Ex: ulauncher-github)
        - Execute the action that is giving error and get the log output.
